Assignment 2: friendly chat app  
  
A new Flutter project.

## Android Installation

Clone repository and build with flutter. Users may register with an email or Google account. Once signed in they may create a new chat with the 'plus' icon on the app bar. This allows them to search for a user with an email or a display name. After selecting a person to message the user then must name their conversation. Once named the user is taken back to their list of conversations. Conversations will display the last message sent. When a conversation is selected the user is taken to the chat screen of that conversation. The user may add additional people to the conversation with the 'plus' icon on the chat screen app bar.
